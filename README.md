# Processing

Here are some of my independent explorations in Processing. Feel free to check out the example images and play around with the code yourself!

CirclePixels: "grows" a mosaic-like cluster of circles based on an initial image.

MengerSponge: a 3D fractal. Iterations are capped so you don't brick your GPU :)

MultiplicationArt: visual depiction of modular multiplication around a circle. Click on screen to change factor.
